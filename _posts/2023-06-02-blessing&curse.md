"Now there is another tree to eat from. It represents the decision to try and seize abundance and life on our own terms, by our own wisdom."
We thought it was a shortcut to blessing. "And instead of blessing, this tree brings a curse", which is 
"... the consequence of seizing our own blessing on our own terms".
