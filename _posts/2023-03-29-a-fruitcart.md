A fruit cart in a backstreet. <br/>
I found this memory-evoking picture on twitter, which supprisingly resembles the neighourhood I grew up in.<br/>
The wooden doors, locks, tiles on the sidewalk and the cart itself could have convinced me that it was taken in a Chinese town. <br/>
The only thing left me in doubt, though, was the window grill design. And yes, it turned out to be somewhere in Marrakesh, Morocco.
