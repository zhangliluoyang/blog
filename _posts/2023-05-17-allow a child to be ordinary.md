Telling a child that they are especially gifted, clever or beautiful might sound like an act of love. Yet there is something far from loving – indeed cruel – about burdening a child with expectations of greatness for which it has no interest, let alone capacity.

Such a child may wind up mentally unwell because they were looked up to with a troubling over-intensity: praised for capacities they did not possess, and obliged to shoulder the hopes of their carers, rather than their own deep selves.

High expectations might seem to offer a route to enormous self-confidence and security. But to place them on someone who still struggles with their coat buttons can leave a child feeling hollow and particularly incapable.

Unable to sense any resources within itself to honour the hopes of those it loves and depends on, the child grows up with a latent sense of fraudulence – and consistent fear that it will be unmasked.

The more loving alternative to fulsome praise is to allow a child to be ordinary – to ask nothing more of it than that it should be allowed to exist, and find satisfaction in modest, everyday things.
